* Use WordPress’ builtin plugin installation system located in your WordPress admin panel, labeled as the "Add New" options in the "Plugins" menu to upload the zip file you downloaded
* Extract the zip file and upload the resulting "ink" folder on your server under `wp-content/plugins/`.

All you need to do after that is navigate to your blog’s administration panel, go in the plugins section and enable No Open Sans font from Google fonts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I have to have a `Category location`? =

As of right now, I needed a way to exclude other parent categories. This seemed like the best method so far.

= How do I get this to only show up on a single product page? =

Here is a great free plugin that does it all for you: [WooSidebars](http://www.woothemes.com/woosidebars)
